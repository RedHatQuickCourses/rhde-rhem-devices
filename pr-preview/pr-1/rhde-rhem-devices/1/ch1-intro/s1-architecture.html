<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Edge computing</em> is any computing infrastructure that is located close to the source of data generation or production, such as a plant floor, a retail store, or an offshore oil rig.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <em>edge site</em> is any location where you have edge computing resources.
It could be as small as a single automated teller machine in a retail store, a few point of sale systems in a drug store, or an automated pick up location, such as an Amazon Locker, in a train terminal.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/Edge-site.svg" alt="Edge site">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Characteristics of edge sites</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some edge sites, like a cruise ship or a department store, may contain a large number of computing resources and even a "server room" with compute and network racks, uninterruptive power supplies, and other resources similar to a data center.
But other edge sites may put compute resources in an environment which the ower of the edge resources do not fully control, exposed to the climate and to tampering by outsiders, including from customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike traditional data centers and large office buildings, edge sites often face limitations regarding power, cooling, and hardware capabilities.
Edge sites may also be disconnected, air-gapped, or have low bandwidth connections to the outside.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But more important than hardware and networing capabilities, edge sites often lack on-site Information Technology (IT) expertise, prioritizing other needs from the <em>Operational Technology</em> (OT) domain, such as PLC programming, radiology equipment maintenance, or non-IT and non-OT needs such as store management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditional IT management tools focus on the high capacity, always connected, and highly standardized world of data centers and clouds, and they cater to the needs of IT personel only.
Edge management tools, on the other hand, must be friendlier to OT personal and deal with the large variety of form factors, intermitent network connectivity, limited hardware capabilities, and possibly harsh conditions of edge sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While edge computing used to be the domain of highly specialized and proprietary devices and software, there&#8217;s a desire to be closer to the world of cloud computing, to enable workload portability, better integration with corporate systems, and deployment of novell applications such as artificial intelligence, which require corporate resources for development or to integrate with larger business processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nowadays, there&#8217;s an emerging class of edge devices which are much closer to traditional computers, having the capability to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux and benefit from containerized applications, and leading vendors are applying to edge computing more and more of the open source tools and agile processes that used to be viable only for cloud computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that context of enabling the use of more standardized hardware and open source innovations for edge use cases, Red Hat offers a number of solutions, among them Red Hat Device Edge.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of components of RHDE, except for MicroShift, are available as part of other Red Hat products, and when that happens their contents are not changed in any way, compared to what is provided by Red Hat Device Edge.
You get the same features from each component, no matter which product subscription provides them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the RHEL you get from RHDE is the same RHEL you get from a regular RHEL subscription.
There are no changes in RHEL capabilities and it provides the same packages and containers.
It provides the same Linux kernel, the same libraries, and the same system services.
This ensures that, as developers build and test applications on the data center, that software runs unchanged on edge devices running RHDE, as long as their applications do not demand more capabilities than available on the targer devices and sites.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 3. Two ways of procuring Red Hat Edge Manager</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main benefit of purchasing RHDE, instead of other Red Hat products which provide the some of the same components, is lower cost.
Most RHEL subscriptions assume data center servers, containing many CPUs, lots of memory, and capable of serving hundreds or even thousand of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHDE, on the other hand, has a cost that is aligned with small devices, which are single-CPU, have a small amount of memory, and usually run a single application for a single user at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nothing prevents RHDE from running multiple applications in parallel, serving some dozen of users, and this is common in a class of edge devices usually known as <em>edge gateways</em>, which collect data and control multiple smaller edge devices, like security cameras and industrial sensors, that would not be able to run RHDE by themselves.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHDE is only one of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/products/edge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many solutions</a> that Red Hat offers for edge computing.
For example, your edge devices may be powerful enough to run Red Hat OpenShift using the single node, two nodes, or three nodes (compact cluster) topologies and support legacy virtualization applications, while still being smaller than typical data center servers.
In such cases, you could use distributed computing unit (DCU) SKUs of RHEL and OpenShift, for cost optimization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example: connectivity to your edge sites may be good enough that you could run Red Satelite capsule servers and Ansible execution nodes (from Ansible automation mesh) on your edge sites, and even a regional ACM cluster, conected to a central global hub cluster, and manage your edge computing resources mostly as you would manage a regional data center or campus.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some edge sites may be best designed with a mix of solutions: a few larger servers and applications run with data center tools, such as package mode RHEL and Red Hat OpenShift, while armies of smaller edge devices and gateways run with RHDE and RHEM.
For such sites, running RHEM integrated with ACM or AAP may be the best approach.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way of describing Red Hat Edge Manager is as providing <em>Kubernetes-style GitOps for the operating system</em>.
RHEM manages declarative state about managed devices and continuosuly monitors that state, detecting dift and reconcilliating any deviations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an administrator alters the declared state, RHEM ensures that managed devices are changed to be consistent with the new state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an administrator changes some state of a device that is managed by RHEM, for example by using a direct SSH connection, RHEM reverts that change to maintain the device consistent with the declared state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can store the declarative configuration of managed devices inside of RHEM&#8217;s own database, as inline configurations, but the recommended practice is to store most of them in a git repository, which makes updates, testing, and troubleshooting easier.</p>

<p>Red Hat Edge Manager is based on the <a href="https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flight Control</a> open source project, and its capabilities are expanding quickly.
Future releases of RHEM may add a number of features, sich as support for managing devices not running image mode for RHEL or additional types of applications, such as Helm applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way RHEM supports image mode for RHEL and containerized applications adapts to different apporoach that IT and OT teams take to their own organization:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some teams may opt for a fully "appliance" approach, where applications are embeded into the operating system image as a single artifact, and OT field people just turns the device on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other teams may opt for a right separation of concerns, where an infrastructure team manages operating system configurations and hardware lifecycle, while other teams manage application lifecycle and data.</p>

<h2 id="_fleet_management_with_red_hat_edge_manager"><a class="anchor" href="#_fleet_management_with_red_hat_edge_manager"></a>Fleet Management with Red Hat Edge Manager</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of <em>fleet management</em> is key to RHEM.
This concepts applies a proven cloud-based practice to operating system management: managing applications and cloud instances as undifferentiated sets, instead of unique entities, each one with their own specific settings.
If you heard the analogy of <em>pets vs cattle</em>, RHEM enables you to manage the operating system and applications in edge devices as <em>cattle</em>.</p>

<img src="_images/fleets.svg" alt="fleets">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 7. Managing individual devices vs managing fleets of devices</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you define once the configuration of all pont of sale (PoS) systems in all your stores, and let RHEM apply the configuration to all of them.
RHEM will also let you know which ones were updated or not to the latest configuration, so you can investigate the failure: is the device disconnected?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, RHEM continuously monitors the health of its managed devices, as long as they can connect to the RHEM server, and report conditions such as low free disk space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively you could define a configuration only for the PoS systems in a single store or all stores in a single a region, before applying it to all your remaining stores.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHEM provides mechanisms to create small variations to target individual devices of a fleet, or to create subsets of devices in the same fleet.
It is not a rigid approach of all managed devices must be configured in exactly the same way, but it is flexible enough to address small variations in a centralized manner, for example: each edge site contains its own HTTP proxy server and all PoS systems must use the proxy from their own site.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHEM can be used by itself, as the single edge device management tool, from provisioning to decomissioning, and to manage all applications running on managed devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, RHEM can work integrated with other <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/managing-red-hat-device-edge-tools-and-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">management tools from Red Hat</a>, such as Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM).
Teams that have mature practices and skills on such tools may benefit from using them together with RHEM, and over time adopt more and more of RHEM capabilities, as they perceive advantages of using them compared to the capabilities they are alreaydy familiar with and were already using for data centers and clouds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you opt for deploying RHEM integrated with either ACM or AAP, RHEM looks like it is part of those platforms, integrated to their web interfaces, their API routing, and using their authentication and authorization mechanisms, but still offering its own features and APIs.
For example: if you deploy RHEM on OpenShift, with or without ACM, RHEM still stores managed device state on its own database instead of using Kubernetes custom resources to store managed device state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you opt for deploying RHEM standalone on either RHEL or OpenShift, you may still need other tools to provide capabilities not included in RHEM, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Red Hat Satellite</strong>, to manage RPM package repositories made available to developers who build operating system images and network boot artifacts made available to edge sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Red Hat Quay</strong>, to manage operating system images (bootc container images), application container images, helm charts, Large Language Models (LLMs), and other software artifacts made available to developers and edge sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</strong> to manage networking gear in edge sites or between those sites and corporate data centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform</strong> to offer developers an application platform to build, test, and secure containerized applications and bootc container images that will be deployed on edge sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Red Hat AI</strong> to fine-tune standard LLMs, populate Retrieval-Aumented Generation (RAG) databases, test guard-rails to ensure model safety, evaluate models to avoid bias, and develop AI-enabled application that will be deployed on edge sites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, you could use alternative tools from any other vendor to provide similar capabilities and still benefit from RHEM.</p>

IT and OT professionals who are already familiar with Kubernetes may notice many similarities between the structure of their APIs, their CLIs, and underlying concepts, such as the reconcilliation loop.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you make the analogy between RHEM and Kubernetes, the server piece of RHEM provides the API server, resource controllers, and state database.
Individual managed devices run an RHEM agent, similar to a kubelet, which observes configuration changes from the API server and state changes from the device itself, and reconciles them if there is any difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But RHEM is still a new product, and you may miss some of the conforts already provided by Kubernetes.
We expect some of them will be added over time, based on community and customer demand.
For example, RHEM does not provide a self-description of its own API resources, like Kubernetes offers with its <code>explain</code> command.
And RHEM is not extensible with custom resource types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, RHEM offers a much less intimimating learning curve, with a feature set tailored to the specific needs of edge device management.
Kubernetes is considered difficult to master because it offers a large number of features, targeting diverse IT needs.
This nature makes it good for many data center and cloud computing scenarios, from software development to virtual machine management.
But you do not require all those features to manage edge devices and edge sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHEM does not attempt to be the single tool to manage all your edge computing needs.
For example, it is not designed to manage network geat at edge sites&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for that you may use Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
RHEM is designed to manage edge devices running RHEL, with or withour MicroShift, at scale and under the constraints of connectivity that common at edge sites, enabling workflows that are friendly to OT personel.</p>
