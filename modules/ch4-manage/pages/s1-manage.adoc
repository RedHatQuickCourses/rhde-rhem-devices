How to inject system configurations, including sensitive configurations (secrets), on a device after or during enrollment.

* Discussion of what to configure at image build time, at device provisioning time (from kickstart or cloud-init) and at day-2.

* Introduce the concept of onboarding as adding configurations which make a device able to function, for example secrets to connect to other edge or corporate network services, which are not recommended to bake at build or installation time.

* Updating the SO/image in a device, updating settings, onboarding, or repurposing a device to serve a different purpose are all the same in the bootc/RHEM world. It’s about the intent, but use the same YAML/APIs/commands in RHEM.

* Mention common issues with updating or switching bootc images and refer to the image mode quick course series.
