= Remove Edge Devices from Red Hat Edge Manager

Goal::
Decommission managed devices.

This chapter explains the differences between the decmomission and delete operations on a device.
For Edge Manager, decomissioning a device is just a change of status and removal of labels, while deleting a device actually removes its API resource from Edge Manager.
