* Architectural components (slide #13) and services of RHEM: microservices/API, inventory, web UI (on server) and agent (on managed devices) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17cWSUdQnS5mSHaiLQieJO24tiPp3VzAu9dIsKc-fyAw/edit?slide=id.g33d0db3e9fb_0_2408#slide=id.g33d0db3e9fb_0_2408

* Mention supported configuration and authentication providers, and their purpose, how they enable seamless integration with ACM or AAP, but focus on the ones to be used in the course: inline, Git, and sssd.

* Overview of the process of deploying containerized RHEM (quadlets) from RPM Packages.

* If there are issues configuring the sssd authentitcaion provider, or if it does not support RBAC, it may become necessary to include Keycloack.
