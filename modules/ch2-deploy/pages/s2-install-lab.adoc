= Lab: Install Red Hat Edge Manager Standalone

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Deploy RHEM on RHEL with minimal requirements.

WARNING: Not started yet

== Before you begin

You need a _development machine_ running RHEL, to which you have unrestricted sudo access.
The _development machine_ has access to mirrors of RHEL package repositories and bootc container images.

These instructions were tested on RHEL 10.0 but should work with minimal or no changes on newer and older RHEL releases, since 9.6.

If you are using the course classroom, log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`.
If not, please adapt the instructions to your test environment.

IMPORTANT: This activity is a continuation of the xref:ch2-online:s2-update-lab.adoc[previous lab] of this course.
You must perform the two activities in sequence, without destroying your classroom environment or its VMs.

== Instructions

////

* Verify availability of all required packages and container images.

* Install RHEM using dnf

* Configure DNF to use sssd (if not default) and hostname for the UI.

* Generate and use a TLS certificate using the virtual classroom CA, or add the self-signed certificate to the trust store of the development machine. Avoid disabling TLS validation for CLI and web access.

* Check the health of all RHEM systemd services/quadlets/containers.

* Connect to RHEM using CLI and Web interface to assess it is healthy and running.
