= Install Red Hat Edge Manager as Quadlets

Goal::

Deploy Edge manager on RHEL from RPM packages.

This chapter introduces the main Edge Manager components and how they run on RHEL as Podman Containers, using quadlets managed by the System Daemon (Systemd).
It also presents the PAM issue component of Edge Manager, which enables use of local users instead of an external identity management system.
Finally, this chapter introduces the two main interfaces of Edge Manager, a command-line interface (CLI) and a web user interface (web UI).
